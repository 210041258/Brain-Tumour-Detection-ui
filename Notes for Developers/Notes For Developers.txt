Tii Vit_part1 : 210041240: Kazi Shakkhar Rahman

A Vision Transformer (ViT) model was implemented for brain tumour detection.

**Achieved 94–96% accuracy on a completely separate testing dataset.

Ensured strict separation between training and testing datasets (no overlap).

Created detailed visualizations (confusion matrix, learning curves).

Added a simplified testing interface in the notebook.

Prerpocessed and Seperated Datasets.

Provided dataset download links and prepared the environment for easy use.


Advice :

Follow the Notesbooks Text Fields to easily run it. Ensure Mounting With Google drive. All Are given in notebooks.
It will save your time.

###Open fields for further development:


***
The core model is complete and has achieved strong accuracy using a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). However, there are several clear areas open for further development beyond accuracy improvement:
***
Learning Enhancements:
-------------------------------
Use Domain Adaptation to generalize across different datasets.

Apply Self-Supervised Learning to leverage unlabeled data.

Implement Federated Learning to enable privacy-preserving collaboration.


UI & Deployment:
-------------------------------
Build a user interface using Streamlit or Gradio.

Deploy the model for real-world use (web or local).


Interpretability & Visualization:
-------------------------------
Add tools like:

t-SNE for feature space visualization.

Grad-CAM to highlight image regions influencing predictions.
